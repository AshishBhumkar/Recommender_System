-----------------------------------------------------------------
Features and Algorithms:
1. I used User-Based Collaborative Filtering technique. It uses user-based similarity to predict the user rating. I compute user similarity using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient algorithm and then calculate weighted sum to predict final user rating.
2. User based similarity gives better performace and quality due to number of less number compare to items.
3. I have used treashold as 0.2 to collect the users with similar taste and store it in HashMap in order to compute the final rating.
